# Preditctive-Modelling---Advanced-Regression-Techniques-Regularizations

Code for Kaggle Competition - Competition Name: House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques competition
I have used advanced regression techniques like lasso (Regularization technique) to predict the house prices.

Kaggle describes this competition as follows:
“Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won’t begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition’s dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
The house prices competition consists of 79 explantory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. This competition challenges to predict the final price of each home.”
